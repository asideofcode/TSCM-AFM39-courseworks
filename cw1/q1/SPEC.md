Assuming the following information is true for the purposes of this question:

-   18 May 2007 was a Tuesday
-   Thirty days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, saving February alone, which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. And on leap years, twenty-nine.
-   A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

Using the above information, how many Mondays fell on the twelfth (12th) of the month between 1 Jan 1401 to 31 Dec 1800?

You must complete the solution by creating a function in C called `howManyDays`. This should return the answer as an integer and does not have any input parameters. You may create and use additional functions in your solution. Your solution must return an answer within 30 seconds.  Only the following headers are available for you to use:

-   `stdio.h`
-   `stdlib.h`
-   `ctype.h`
-   `string.h`
-   `stdbool.h`
-   `math.h`
